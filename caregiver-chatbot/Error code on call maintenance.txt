Agent: Hello, this is Rosella, I am calling from Independence Care, how are you doing today?
Caregiver: I am doing well! How are you?
Agent: I am also doing good. Thank you very much for asking.
Agent: I see you clocked in but there seems to be no schedule on your Calander, can you confirm the client you are working with today? 
Caregiver: yeah, I didn’t see (clients name) on the calendar, but I work for (clients name) every Monday through Friday 9am to 5pm. Should I leave?
Agent: No, please do not leave. Unfortunately, the app can malfunction at times and remove Caregivers from schedules. I will add you to the schedule and clock you in, if for any reason this causes an error your coordinator will reach out to you to clarify.

Scenario 2:
Agent: Hello, this is Rosella, I am calling from Independence Care, how are you doing today?
Caregiver: Hi, I am doing okay, how are you?
Agent: I am well, thank you for asking. I see you clocked in but do not currently have a schedule. Can you confirm the client you clocked in for?
Caregiver: (Client's name)
Agent: Thank you for confirming, Is this your regular schedule?
Caregiver: No, this is not my regular schedule. I usually do Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays but the client asked me to come in today (Tuesday).
Agent: Okay, thank you for letting me know. You will have to remove one of your visits from the schedule this week, would you like to remove Wednesday or Friday?
Caregiver: Friday.
Agent: Okay, no problem. Can you just bring the client to the phone, so I can confirm the change with him?
Caregiver: Sure... “Helloo”
Agent: Hi, can you state your name for me?
Caregiver: (clients name)
Agent: Okay wonderful, Mr.(clients name) because your aide came today, we will need to adjust your schedule so that you do not over service your authorization. Can you confirm that the Caregiver can swap any other day of the week for today?
Caregiver: Yes that is fine.
Agent: Great, your caregiver will be with you today and will no longer be scheduled Friday from 9am to 5pm. Can I help you with anything else?
Caregiver: NO
Agent: Okay, have a great day!

Agent: Ohh! I totally understand, can you tell me what time you are coming today? 
Caregiver: 9am
Agent: Thats great, can you also put the client on the phone so we can confirm with them?

Agent: Hi, can you state your name? 
Caregiver: “clients name”
Agent: Great, can you confirm what time your aide showed up today?
Caregiver: 5 minutes after 9.
Agent: Great, thank you. We will adjust the schedule for a start time of 9:05. We will adjust the scheduled clock out time for 17:05, so you do not lose any hours today. Can you put your aide back on the phone please?
Caregiver: Hello?
Agent: Hi, so the client confirmed you showed up at 9:05 so your schedule has been adjusted to reflect that arrival time. Moving forward, I want to let you know that we are not allowed to make any changes to any clock in or clock out time. So, going forward please make sure you are very careful with your clock in and clock out because we will not be able to adjust them due to (office location) state law. 
Agent: Thank you, have a good day!

Agent: Hello, this is Rosella, I am calling from Independence Care, how are you doing today!
Caregiver: I am doing good! How are you doing today?
Agent: I am also doing good. Thank you very much for asking.
Agent: I have noticed you have clocked in outside of the client's service area, which is not close to your client’s house. Can you please clock in again once you are at your client’s house, because we are not able to accept this clock in. 
Caregiver: I clocked in at my client’s house, it’s the apps fault 
Agent: I am sorry to hear that but it can’t be the applications fault because all of our CG’s are using the same application and this does not seem to be the issues with anyone else at the moment, but can you try to clock in again and make sure are you inside your client’s house. 
Caregiver: No, I can’t, the app won’t allow me!
Agent: Ohh! Okay there should be an option in your app called unscheduled visit’s try doing it from there and see it if lets you!
Caregiver: Okay, I will try it again. 
Agent: Thank you, please feel free to reach us if you come across any problems. 
Agent: Remember it is (office state) law that a Home Care agency cannot bill for visits that are rendered outside of the client's home.

Caregiver: I have already left my client's house, and I am not able to go back!
Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience this causes but we will not be able to mark your shift as completed without a clock out, so it is really important. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience this is causing. 
 
Caregiver: Okay, I will go back and clock out for my shift. 
Agent: Thank you very much and please make sure going forward you do your clock in/out when you are inside your client’s house. I recommend setting an alarm for yourself to avoid such issues in future.
